            <h3>ABSTRACT</h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>Aim of the study:</strong> To investigate the awareness of schoolchildren
                    and students about the risks of lack of hygienic skills of using electronic
                    devices (ED) for the visual system and eye symptoms.
                    Material and methods: Quantitative indicators were calculated for
                    assessing the impact of risk factors on the state of visual health of
                    768 schoolchildren and students from Russia and Belarus.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>Results:</strong> The majority of respondents adequately assessed the risk
                    of exposure to behavioral factors for health and eyesight. The majority
                    of respondents rated their health as "good", a quarter of them
                    as "satisfactory". Among respondents, vision was rated as "excellent"
                    by 49 (24.5%) and 147 (25.9%), "good" by 53 (26.5%) and
                    128 (22.5%), "satisfactory" by 36 (18.0%) and 152 (26.8%), "poor"
                    by 62 (31.0%) and 141 (24.8%) of schoolchildren and students,
                    respectively. The main sources of information about the problem
                    of the organs of vision for respondents are the Internet (80%),
                    "parents" (60%), "doctors" (43.0% and 61.8%), "teacher" (36.0%
                    and 61.4%).
                    <br><br>

                    <strong>Conclusions:</strong> Despite a fairly high level of knowledge about
                    the negative impact on vision of irrational work with gadgets, the
                    temptation to use them in adverse visual conditions does not decrease.
                    In the group of schoolchildren, the risk indicator for health
                    and eyesight is more pronounced: a careless attitude to their own
                    health compared to students. University teachers should take into
                    account the fact that students consider the opinion of teachers
                    authoritative for the formation of health-saving competencies of
                    youth.

            <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
                <p>
                    The world is ever changing due to advances in the realm
                    of science and technology. One such advance is in the field
                    of information and communication technology (ICT). ICT
                    has become a standard fixture in the lives of many young
                    people. In addition to the entertainment aspects, electronic
                    devices (ED, gadgets) play an important part in the social
                    lives of people [1]. In recent decades we have witnessed
                    a sharp increase in the availability and use of personal electronic
                    devices (digital devices) such as laptops and handheld
                    computers, smartphones, and institution's computers, tablets
                    and similar and associated devices [2-4]. The percentage of
                    smartphone users - especially among minors - is growing,
                    and there is growing literature suggesting increasing rates of
                    problematic smartphone use in children and adolescents [5].
                    In the last decade Russians purchased about 400 million mobile
                    means of communication [6], in 2019 - the record number
                    of smartphones - 30.14 million pieces. Between 2011 and
                    2017, the use of smartphones by Russian teenagers increased
                    from less than 20% to 80%. More active ICT use may, however,
                    affect the visual system and eye symptoms in a negative
                    way. Many authors have reported the negative effects of overuse
                    of electronic devices during education and leisure [7, 8].
                    According to a survey conducted for the Vision Council 70%
                    of adults say they have experienced some of the symptoms
                    of digital eye strain. It is becoming a widespread problem
                    as more people spend hours each day looking at computers,
                    cellphones, iPads, tablets and other electronic devices [9, 10].
                    As a result, the decrease in vision limits actions, causes a feeling
                    of being unwell, mood decline, and decreased mental
                    performance and quality of life. The long-term ocular effects
                    of smartphone and handheld digital device use are unknown.
                    However, a range of short-term ocular surface discomfort,
                    visual discomfort and asthenopic symptoms are reported
                    with smartphones and tablets use [11, 12]. Ocular surface
                    discomfort includes sore eyes, dryness, stinging, burning,
                    itchiness and irritation. Visual discomfort and asthenopic
                    symptoms include blurred vision, difficulty in refocusing between viewing distances, headache, eye strain and double
                    vision [13, 14].
                    <br><br>
                    With the increasing popularity of electronic devices,
                    youths spend significant time on smartphone and other ICT,
                    thereby developing addictive tendencies. Research concludes
                    that youths are not only addicted but are also developing
                    significant behavioral problems and visual discomfort and
                    symptoms owing to excessive electronic devices usage. All
                    that staring from frequent phone use, computer use, and TV
                    watching can lead to eye strain, a visual health issue that,
                    when found in this context, is often called computer vision
                    syndrome [15]. Symptoms reported by computer users are
                    classified into internal ocular symptoms (strain and ache),
                    external ocular symptoms (dryness, irritation, burning),
                    visual symptoms (blur, double vision) and musculoskeletal
                    symptoms (neck and shoulder pain) [16]. With the increased
                    use of electronic devices with visual displays, computer vision
                    syndrome is becoming a major public health issue [17].
                    <br><br>
                    The basic component of healthy lifestyle of youths is complying
                    with hygiene principles of vision protection. In this
                    connection it is necessary to study the awareness of basic
                    principles of a healthy lifestyle among the youth [12, 18, 19].
                    These main principles are: good-health mindset, mastering
                    the skills of a healthy lifestyle, positive habits, and compliance
                    with hygiene standards for visual health [20]. Based on the
                    widespread use of computer technology and mobile phones
                    in young people and society, we expected high ownership of
                    electronic devices. Further, the devices are expected to have
                    major impacts on the student's life from different aspects.
                    The aim of the study was to investigate the awareness of
                    schoolchildren and students about the risks of lack of hygienic
                    skills of using electronic devices for the visual system
                    and eye symptoms, and to analyze the factors influencing the
                    health and eyesight in modern youth.

                    <strong>Research questions</strong>
                    Based on previously available literature data, the following
                    questions were asked: What is the impact of the time spent
                    using electronic devices on schoolchildren's and students' eye
                    health, dependence and social behavior? What are the main
                    sources of information about the impact of risk factors on
                    health and eyesight?

            <h3>MATERIAL AND METHODS</h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>Study design, setting and population</strong>
                    Using Google Forms, an online survey of 200 schoolchildren
                    of grades 9-10 (age 15-16 years) from general educational
                    organizations, gymnasiums and lyceums was conducted.
                    568 students (age 17-21 years) were also surveyed:
                    73% studied in the field of healthcare and medical sciences,
                    20% studied in education and pedagogical sciences, and the
                    rest studied in the field of mathematical and natural sciences.
                    The respondents lived in Russia (Moscow and the Moscow
                    Region, Samara, Arkhangelsk, Tomsk) and Belarus (Grodno).
                    <br>
                    In this research we showed that information and communication
                    technologies (Internet resource) and the voluntary
                    informed consent from respondents can be used instead of
                    the traditional questioning with paper forms. For example,
                    Google Forms can provide us with mechanisms to allow us
                    to make different questionnaires. Data could be transformed
                    into Excel or another database with the opportunities of analysis
                    in different statistical programs. The benefit of internet
                    questionnaires is a significant reduction in survey costs. The
                    questionnaire was developed by teachers of the Department
                    of Hygiene at the Pediatric Faculty of the N.I. Pirogov Federal
                    State Autonomous Educational Establishment of Higher Education
                    in the name of N. I. Pirogova of the Ministry of Health
                    of Russia, with certificates of specialist "Hygienic education",
                    "Hygiene of children and adolescents", "General hygiene".
                    Respondents were asked questions of an evaluative nature:
                    "Assess the degree of risk on health and eyesight..."". The questions
                    are related to a subjective assessment of the impact of
                    risk factors on health and, in particular, the organ of vision
                    and visual health. The total risk of exposure to the factor was
                    assessed on a 10-degree numerical scale, where 1 meant weak
                    intensity and 10 meant the highest intensity of the risk factor.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>Statistical analysis</strong>
                    The statistical analysis was conducted with STATISTICA
                    v. 13 software (StatSoft). The compliance of the obtained values
                    with the law of the normal distribution of the variational series
                    was evaluated. Normality of variable distribution was tested
                    using the Shapiro-Wilk test. Quantitative data had a distribution
                    that did not differ from normal - methods of parametric
                    statistics were used. Comparison of the quantitative variable
                    values in two groups was performed using Student's t-test. In
                    order to identify differences and relationships between variables,
                    the χ2 test was used [21]. Values with a probability of
                    p < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>Ethical considerations</strong>
                    The study was carried out in accordance with the requirements
                    of the 1975 Helsinki Declaration (as amended in 2000)
                    [22]. The study did not infringe on human rights, did not endanger
                    the respondents, met the requirements of biomedical
                    ethics: reviewed and approved in accordance with the good
                    clinical practice (GCP) rules by the Regional Committee for
                    Medical and Health Research Ethics in Pirogov Russian National
                    Research Medical University. All studies were carried
                    out in compliance with the ethical standards [23].
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>RESULTS</strong>
                    Interviewed groups of schoolchildren and students did
                    not have significant gender differences. 146 (73%) of the
                    respondents from school and 431 (75.9%) from university
                    were girls (Pearson χ2 test = 0.7, p > 0.1). The groups of respondents
                    did not have significant differences, as they subjectively
                    assessed their state of health and their vision health.
                    105 (52.5%) pupils rated their health as "good", 44 (22.0%)
                    as "satisfactory". 306 (53.9%) students rated their health as
                    "good", 161 (28.3%) as "satisfactory" (Pearson χ2 test = 6.9,
                    p > 0.05) (Figure 1).
                    <br><br>
                    Among schoolchildren, eye health was rated as "excellent"
                    by 49 (24.5%), "good" by 53 (26.5%), "satisfactory"
                    by 36 (18.0%), "poor" by 62 (31.0%); among students -
                    147 (25.9%), 128 (22.5%), 152 (26.8%) and 141 (24.8%), respectively
                    (Figure 2).
                    <br><br>
                    98.9% of schoolchildren and students use electronic
                    devices daily. 420 respondents (54.7%) in both groups use
                    a smartphone player or other electronic device with headphones
                    daily. The average time spent in front of a device per
                    day was between 4 and 5 h.
                    <br><br>
                    Average values for assessing the impact of risk factors indicate
                    that older schoolchildren and students adequately assess
                    the risk of exposure to behavioral factors for health (Table I).
                    <br><br>
                    For respondents "an adequate assessment of the risk of exposure
                    to a factor" was 5-7 points; for students 6-8 points. For
                    factors affecting the organ of vision, the degree of health risk
                    when working with electronic devices has been established:
                    in low light conditions only 26 (13.0%) schoolchildren and
                    72 (12.7%) students are ready to abstain from work until
                    returning to a well-lit place. Work in an unsuitable place
                    (armchair, bed, on the floor, etc.) is chosen by 114 (57.0%)
                    schoolchildren and 304 (53.5%) students. Work without interruption
                    for 2 hours or more - 55 (27.5%) and 147 (25.9%);
                    usually rest periods when working with electronic devices
                    are not used - 45 (22.5%) and 96 (16.9%), respectively. There
                    were no statistically significant differences between groups.
                    <br><br>
                    Respondents were asked questions characterizing the
                    practical skills of lifestyle and eye protection. To the question
                    "Do you often take breaks to relax when working with electronic
                    devices?" 39 (19.5%) schoolchildren stated that they
                    take a break every 30-40 minutes, which is consistent with
                    the hygienic principles of vision protection. This indicator
                    among students is 137 (24.1%). 48 (24.0%) and 105 (18.5%)
                    respondents, respectively, do not take breaks when working
                    with electronic devices.

                    If it is necessary to work with electronic devices in a darkened
                    room, only 26 (13.0%) schoolchildren will refrain from
                    working, which is consistent with the hygienic principles of
                    vision protection. 74 (37.0%) will continue to work in any
                    conditions. 34 (17.0%) of schoolchildren can use electronic
                    devices while lying down and 80 (40.0%) while sitting on
                    the bed. 72 (12.7%) students will refrain from working if it
                    is necessary to work with electronic devices in a darkened
                    room. 214 (37.9%) will continue to work in any conditions.
                    264 (46.5%) students working with electronic devices work at
                    an organized workplace. The rest can use electronic devices
                    while lying down (113; 19.9%) and sitting on the bed (191;
                    33.6%); no significant differences between groups.
                    <br><br>
                    88 (44.0%) schoolchildren answered that they do not
                    need vision correction - they are schoolchildren who rated
                    their vision as "excellent" and "good". 239 (42.1%) students
                    replied that they did not need vision correction. When working
                    with electronic devices, 11 (5.5%) pupils and 23 (4.0%)
                    students surveyed use specially selected glasses, 37 (18.5%)
                    and 122 (21.5%) do not use glasses, but they require vision
                    correction (they use glasses selected "for distance") and
                    54 (27.0%) and 150 (26.4%) use ordinary glasses, respectively.
                    Thus, nearly 40% of schoolchildren and students do not
                    adhere to the principles of vision protection in life. The risk
                    group of schoolchildren and students who rated their eyesight
                    as "poor" was determined (68; 33.5%), and when questioned,
                    they answered that "vision correction is not needed”
                    (11; 5.4%), "I need vision correction, but I don't use glasses”
                    (57; 28.1%) (Table II).

                    The main sources of information on preventive measures
                    for the protection of vision for schoolchildren are information
                    from the Internet - 158 (79.0%), information from "parents,
                    relatives" - 111 (55.5%), "medical professional” - 86 (43.0%)
                    and "teacher" - 72 (36.0%). 22 (11.0%) respondents are not
                    interested this topic and problem. The main sources of information
                    for students are the Internet - 503 (88.6%), "medical
                    professional" - 351 (61.8%), "teacher" - 349 (61.4%), "parents
                    and relatives" - 342 (60.2%), and 20 (3.5%) respondents are
                    not interested in this topic and problem (Figure 3).

                    <strong>DISCUSSION</strong>
                    The modern education system is a "risk zone" due to the
                    intensity of the educational process, which is accompanied by
                    stresses (mental), decreased physical activity, and disturbances
                    in sleep and rest. The learning process is characterized by
                    dynamism, high labor intensity, a variety of forms and methods
                    of training, an increase in the amount of information,
                    and the introduction of new training tools and technologies,
                    which requires additional reserves from the body [24, 25].
                    An urgent problem of modern public health is the increasing
                    activity of the use of ED, gadgets and, as a result, the increase
                    in negative effects on the organ of vision under their influence.
                    Children and adolescents are growing up exposed to
                    modern information and communication technology. Studies
                    have shown such modern technologies as smartphones,
                    tablets, and computers that have been developed and become
                    increasingly widespread over the past decade to be beneficial
                    and to constitute health risks for youth [26]. An awareness of
                    the basics of a healthy lifestyle and the hygienic principles of
                    vision protection was shown by more than 50% of schoolchildren
                    and students. Respondents adequately assessed the risk
                    of behavioral factors affecting health and visual health. Everyone
                    who spends a lot of time behind the screen of telephone
                    displays, tablets and computers is prone to computer vision
                    syndrome. Schoolchildren and students experience a variety
                    of ocular symptoms related to computer use, such as redness,
                    blurred vision, double vision, eye strain - symptoms of computer
                    vision syndrome [27, 28]. The results of studies on the
                    health status of schoolchildren and university students have
                    shown a steady negative trend towards an increase in diseases
                    caused by the influence of educational environment factors.
                    There is an increase in functional disorders and chronic diseases
                    of the body systems (musculoskeletal, digestive, nervous,
                    visual organs) acquired in the learning process [25].
                    Health disorders acquired during school years are exacerbated
                    during continuing education at university [18]. A lot
                    of youth face eye problems when they sit in front of a television
                    or a laptop screen for hours on end. In addition to this,
                    eye strain can lead to eye fatigue, blurry vision, and focus
                    issues, which can be very irritating and dangerous. Authors
                    have stated the negative effect of overuse of electronic devices
                    during education and leisure [29, 30]. In our study, mobile
                    phones, smartphones and laptops were the gadgets most frequently
                    used by respondents. Vision was considered "excellent" by 25.9% of respondents, "good" by 22.5%, "satisfactory"
                    by 26.8% and "bad" by 24.8%. Using gadgets for a long time
                    can produce symptoms of computer vision syndrome. The
                    average time spent in front of a device per day was between
                    4 and 5 hours. When using mobile phones and laptops with
                    an average use of 1 to 4 hours per day, subjective signs were
                    distinguished: blurred vision, headache and stuffy eyes [28].
                    The authors of this study indicate that visual complaints were
                    reported by 75% of the users who work for more than 5 hours
                    [28]. The results of the study connect long-term work with
                    a computer display and the accelerated development of symptoms
                    such as burning sensation and foreign body, diplopia,
                    and myopia [29].
                    <br><br>
                    The negative trends in the state of the organ of vision
                    among schoolchildren and students and the negative trends
                    in lifestyle revealed in the study require training in healthy
                    lifestyle skills in educational institutions. The role of the
                    teacher in this process is significant. As preventive hygiene
                    measures to protect eyesight, it is recommended to use electronic
                    devices only in places with a good level of illumination,
                    including artificial ones, with continuous use of no more
                    than 60 min, using glasses if necessary and correcting vision.
                    It is necessary to expand the knowledge of these population
                    groups on healthy lifestyle issues and motivate them to use
                    knowledge in professional activities and everyday life.
                    <br><br>
                    This study employed a large, well-defined populationbased
                    sample of youth. This sample had a limited age range.
                    The data employed in this study are from a recent data collection.
                    The cross-sectional design of this study precluded any
                    causal inference.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>CONCLUSIONS</strong>
                    The results of the assessment of the (subjective) awareness
                    of schoolchildren and students about the consequences
                    of the irrational use of electronic devices and the hygienic
                    principles of vision protection indicated that more than half
                    of the respondents adequately assessed the risk of exposure
                    to behavioral factors on health and the organ of vision. Despite
                    a fairly high level of knowledge about the negative impact
                    on vision of irrational work with gadgets, the temptation
                    to use them in adverse visual conditions does not decrease.
                    In the group of schoolchildren, the risk indicator for health
                    and functional disorders of the organ of vision is more pronounced:
                    a careless attitude to their own health compared
                    to students.
                    <br><br>
                    More than half of schoolchildren perceive parents, medical
                    workers and friends as "sources" of information about
                    a healthy lifestyle. Almost two thirds of students perceive
                    health workers, teachers and parents as the "source" of information
                    about a healthy lifestyle. University teachers should
                    take into account the fact that students consider the opinion
                    of teachers authoritative for the formation of health-saving
                    competencies of youth.
