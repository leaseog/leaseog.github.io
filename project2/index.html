    <h1>Muscles Affected <br> by Sitting All Day</h1>
    <h3>By  Dan Ketchum</h3>
        <p>
            Spending a whole lot of time in an inactive posture isn't just a bad habit - your mom already told you that one. On a larger scale, it's such a widespread health concern that the term sitting disease long ago entered the health care lexicon.
            <br><br>
            If you do a lot of sitting, you're definitely not sitting alone; a November 2018 JAMA survey of nearly 6,000 American adults reports that one in four people sit for more than eight hours every day. As you might expect, that staggering statistic exerts an equally significant influence on the body - an influence that goes well beyond muscles to affect everything from the cardiovascular system to mental health.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Tip</strong>
            <br>
            Sitting primarily engages core ab and back muscles while leaving the leg muscles at rest, but the effects of a sedentary lifestyle reach much further than simple muscle engagement.
        </p>

    <h3>What Happens When You Sit?</h3>
        <p>
            When your body assumes sitting posture, explains Cornell University, much of your weight is transferred to the pelvis, particularly to the ischial tuberosities, rounded bones at the pelvis's bottom also appropriately known as sit bones. In a sitting position with fairly even weight distribution, your legs meet your hips at roughly 135 degrees, with your knees bent at 45 degrees.
            <br>
            When your body sits, muscles do most of the work against gravity, as long as you practice proper posture. In this position, the muscles deep in your abdomen, pelvis and back - collectively known as the core stability muscles - support your upright posture. Muscles such as the rectus abdominis, iliocostalis lumborum and multifidus muscles help maintain spinal stability.
            <br>
            Because sitting leaves your leg muscles at rest, the Department of Health and Human Services at Victoria, Australia, warns that prolonged sitting can lead to weakening of large leg and gluteal muscles. Extended periods of sitting also stress the hip flexors, causing them to shorten over time and leading to potential hip joint complications.
            <br>
            According to Cornell University, sitting puts about 40 to 90 percent more pressure on your back compared to standing. Another of the key physiological problems with sitting is that you simply expend less energy compared to when you stand or move. And less energy expenditure means less calorie burn, which can lead to weight gain and cardiovascular complications.
        </p>

    <h3>How You Sit Counts</h3>
        <p>
            Your posture exerts a huge effect on the biomechanics of sitting. For instance, when you're in a neutral, relaxed and unsupported position, your center of mass is just above the ischial tuberosities, and the ground supports about a quarter of your body weight.
            <br>
            A small study of 37 adults published in the January 2019 edition of Gait and Posture finds that slouched sitting engages the bilateral obliquus and transversus abdominis muscles less than sitting more upright. A similarly modest field study of 13 office workers in the April 2013 issue of the Journal of Electromyography and Kinesiology notes that in a relaxed posture, the lumbar muscles experience very low activation. This transmits the load to ligaments and intervertebral discs, which may account for long-term lower back pain.
            Your chair matters too. Tall chairs put pressure on the popliteal fold of the knees, which can decrease circulation, while a higher backrest encourages better trunk support and weight distribution. A small study of 70 individuals published in the February 2019 edition of Physical Therapy finds that posture does not affect pain levels in the rotator cuff muscles. Exercises, of course, can help relieve pain from sitting all day - but it's even better if that pain isn't there in the first place.
       </p>

    <h3>Too Much Sitting: Potential Effects</h3>
        <p>
            According to the Mayo Clinic, obesity is among the most prominent potential effects of too much sitting, often resulting in excess fat around the waist. The amount of calories you burn while sitting versus standing plays a role here, as it does in the many cardiovascular concerns of extended sitting, which include increased blood pressure and abnormal cholesterol levels. All told, people who sit for more than eight hours a day with no physical activity have a risk of dying similar to that of those who smoke.
            In January of 2015, the Annals of Internal Medicine published an extensive review of 47 studies investigating mortality rates, hospitalization and the incidence of disease in sedentary adults. Their data found that prolonged sedentary time - including excess sitting - is associated with "deleterious health outcomes" such as an increased incidence of Type 2 diabetes, and increased both incidence and mortality rates for cardiovascular disease and certain types of cancer (including lung, uterine and colon cancers).
            <br>
            In September of 2018, the Journal of Applied Physiology revealed another interesting effect of prolonged sitting via a small study of 15 people. Researchers found that long periods of sedentary behavior such as sitting actually reduces cerebral blood flow, which in turn leads to lower cognitive functioning and an increased risk of neurodegenerative disease. On the same note, a more sedentary lifestyle is associated with increased instances of anxiety and depression.
            As blood pools in your leg muscles while you sit, it may also lead to the typically harmless appearance of varicose or "spider" veins. In more serious but rarer cases, this can cause blood clots in the legs that have the potential to break off and travel to other parts of the body (such as the lungs), creating a condition known as deep vein thrombosis.

    <h3>Inactive Posture: Solutions</h3>
        <p>
            Filling your life with more movement will do a whole lot more than just help you maintain muscle tone. In an analysis of 13 studies spanning over 1 million people, Mayo Clinic concluded that just 60 to 75 minutes of moderately intense physical activity per day can counter the negative effects of too much sitting. At Mayo, Edward R. Laskowski, MD, says, "The impact of movement - even leisurely movement - can be profound. ... This might lead to weight loss and increased energy."
            Some easily accessible ways to counteract too much sitting include:
        </p>
            <ul style="font-size: 18pt;">
                <li>Stand and move around every 30 minutes (download an alarm app on your computer to help).</li>
                <li>Stand while you watch TV.</li>
                <li>Use a treadmill as a work surface for your laptop.</li>
                <li>Do housework or take walks while engaging in audio content such as music, audiobooks or podcasts.</li>
            </ul>

            You can even burn more calories while at your desk by using a standing desk, taking phone calls while standing up or walking around, or intentionally moving your trash bin away from your desk to encourage yourself to take small, frequent walking trips. When it comes to counteracting the sitting slumps, even a little activity can go a long - and worthwhile - way.

    <h1>Sitting Disease: How a Sedentary Lifestyle Affects Heart Health</h1>
    <h3>Reviwed by Erin Donnelly Michos, M.D., M.H.S.</h3>
        <p>
            If you find yourself planted behind a desk or stuck in the car for much of your day, you're not alone. Thanks to the convenience of technology and our modern lifestyles, people in the U.S. are more inactive than ever. 
            <br>
            According to the American Heart Association, sedentary jobs have increased 83 percent since 1950. Physically active jobs now make up less than 20 percent of the U.S. workforce, down from roughly half of jobs in 1960.
            All of that inactivity is taking a toll on health. Johns Hopkins cardiologist Erin Michos, M.D., M.H.S. , associate director of preventive cardiology at the Ciccarone Center for the Prevention of Heart Disease , shares research about the dangers of sitting and what you can do about it.
        </p>
    <h3>Q: How does so much sitting affect health?</h3>
        <p>
            Michos: A large review of studies published in 2015 in the Annals of Internal Medicine found that even after adjusting for physical activity, sitting for long periods was associated with worse health outcomes including heart disease , Type 2 diabetes and cancer. Sedentary behavior can also increase your risk of dying, either from heart disease or other medical problems.
            Even if you're doing 30 minutes per day of physical activity, it matters what you do the other 23 hours of the day.
        </p>
    <h3>Q: Even fitness buffs can be sedentary, as you recently discovered?</h3>
        <p>
            Michos: I consider myself physically active. I run every morning for four or five miles, and I'd pat myself on the back for that. But then I got a step-tracking device and realized I wasn't moving much the rest of the day.
            <br>
            I have a long commute, so I was spending two hours in my car. On days I'm not doing rounds, I'm doing research or teaching, so I might be sitting at my computer for eight hours. I was easily sitting more than 10 hours a day. Outside of my run, I was getting very few steps the rest of the day.
        </p>
    <h3>Q: Does all that sitting cancel out the benefits of your daily running?</h3>
        <p>
            Michos: Not entirely. More recent research shows that high levels of exercise can lessen some of the risk. Yet even for people with high levels of activity, there seems to be a threshold around 10 hours of sitting. Research shows that if you hit more than 10 hours, your cardiovascular risk really goes up.
        </p>
    <h3>Q: How have you changed your own habits?</h3>
        <p>
            Michos: I've made progress. I make an effort to get up and move around every hour. I try to find as many excuses as possible to walk throughout the day. I'll ask myself: Do I really have to send that email to my colleague down the hall, or can I just walk over to her office?
            I've also been having walking meetings. We'll do loops around the hospital and talk as we walk. If it's nice, we'll walk outside. As a bonus, I find fresh air can boost creativity.
        </p>
    <h3>Q: What advice do you have to help others get out of their seats?</h3>
        <p>
            Michos: Even if you have to be sitting in front of the computer all day, you can break up the time. You don't have to replace sitting with time at the gym. There's benefit to light activity during the day. For every 20 minutes of sitting, try to stand for eight minutes and move around for two minutes.
            I recommend everybody track their steps, with a fitness tracker, your phone or a simple pedometer. We usually recommend a target of 10,000 steps a day. But if you're very sedentary, any improvement will be beneficial. If you only get 2,000 steps a day, try to aim for 4,000.
            Take baby steps. It doesn't have to be vigorous. Just stand up and move your muscles.
