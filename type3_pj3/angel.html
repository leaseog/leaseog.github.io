<p>Tattooing, along with other forms of adornment and body marking, dates back to the tribal practices of cultures far removed from today’s technical world. They are associated with processes in which collective life is ritualised conferring them with an identitary and sacred nature, and also with a more mundane desire to decorate one’s body for erotic and aesthetic purposes. In our globalized and industrialized societies we have been witnessing over the past decades the rise of a range of trends aimed at decorating and marking the body that are associated with a certain contemporary hedonism, as well as the development of a fashion and cosmetics industry with strong transnational economic interests. 
    Such considerations that would warrant a more extensive approach in further research, provide us with a perspective in which we can consider the relationship of the current tattoo phenomenon in consonance with that which is invariably human, while here we limit our focus to analysis of cultural phenomena which are usually linked to the immediate and the ephemeral, as is the case of fashion and media.
    It is of interest to highlight some points in relation to fashion: it is an economic phenomenon promoter of consumption and, in this regard, strongly linked to the obsolescence of objects. Thus, Georg Simmel pointed out in early on in the twentieth century tha fashion had been inserted into the mechanisms of the functioning of the market economy, and as such, it was no longer only about goods that become fashionable and generate profits, but about objects manufactured with the purpose of becoming trendy (Simmel, 1988). Roland Barthes explains: “the calculating industrial society, is doomed to create consumers who do not calculate“ (Barthes, 2003: 14)
    Moreover, the ephemeral and transitory nature attributed to fashion is reflected in the following quote from the poet Giacomo Leopardi (1798-1837) who in his work engages fashion in a dialogue with death saying, “FASHION: I’m fashion, your sister. DEATH: My sister? FASHION: Yes, do you not remember that both of us were born of expiration?” (Leopardi, 2013: 14). Later the dialogue continues with provocations enunciated by the very same fashion that startles death; for example, “FASHION: I say that our nature and common uses are continually renewing the world” (Leopardi, 2013: 14). It is interesting that this imagined conversation from the early nineteenth century clearly expresses a quality that is evident in contemporary times, although judging by the words of the poet, it was already certain at that time: in the consumer system, expiration and the need for constant renewal are the mechanisms which oil the wheels of our mercantile society.
    We can thus confirm that in such a highly industrialized society and with a marked presence in the goods market, fashion has become a sector with a strong interest in the renewal and in the creation of needs and tastes that must vary so as to ensure the agility of a market that aspires to be prosperous. However, the commercial dimension has other lines of enormous analytical interest, setting out the need for renewal beyond the usual wear and tear of the product brought about by its use, it is, therefore, necessary to recover objects with images and reasons; in other words, with meaning. Fashion, converted into a system of symbols is able to arouse a desire that drives us to purchase, renew and spend (Barthes, 2003).
    Consequently, the ways in which we cover our bodies are, at the same time, ways of exhibiting it. Fashion gives meaning to the objects with which we cover and decorate ourselves, so that what we wear gives meaning to our self because “wearing a suit is essentially an act of significance beyond the reasons of modesty, adornment and protection. It is an act of significance and therefore a deeply social event in the very heart of the social dialectic” (Barthes, 2003: 419). Indeed, “through fashion, the duplication of showing off and being looked at has been staged as never before; being looked at has led to the search for identity through the image that builds, that adorns and that offers a form of personal narrative, that at the same time attracts the gaze of others” (Walzer, 2008: 170). But fashion is a characteristic weave of the individual and the social so, returning to Simmel, the aspect of fashion as a mask would be a way of taking over the general rules through what is exteriorized in order to maintain personal integrity because by being identified with socially instituted ways, it is possible to be ensured of being recognized by others. It is a way to “combine the interest in permanence, unity and equality with varying interest, particularity and singularity” (Simmel, 1988: 27).
    Maffesoli explains that there is something both tragic and hedonistic which characterizes our time, and which ties in with a certain level of the awareness of the purposelessness in our lives, with the precarious nature of existence and with a certain avidity pulsion. An avidity which is expressed by a means of consumption that is consistent with the hegemonic socio-political model, but also with a life of consumption in which all that is desired can be obtained instantaneously. This avidity can be seen under the form of fashion (Maffesoli, 2001).
    There are, therefore, multiple dimensions which are staged when we try to think of the tattoo as fashion within our contexts and none of these are banal, given that they are all expressions of the individual, society and culture.</p>
