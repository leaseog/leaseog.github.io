        <h1>A Handmade Web</h1>
          <h2>Introduction: Defining the Handmade Web</h2>
              <p>The term '<em>handmade</em>' usually refers to objects made by hand or by using simple tools rather
            than machines. The result may be homely — as in a child's clay ashtray — or exquisite — as in
            a pair of bespoke brogues.
                <br><br>
              <strong>evoke the term '<em>handmade web</em>' to refer to web pages coded by hand rather than by
                software; web pages made and maintained by individuals rather than by businesses or
                corporations; web pages which are provisional, temporary, or one-of-a-kind; web pages
                which challenge conventions of reading, writing, design, ownership, privacy, security, or
                identity.</strong> 
                <br><br>
          <h2>The Emergence of the Handmade Web</h2>
              <p>Handmade web pages flourished in the mid-to-late-1990s, in the brief period after the academic
                web and before the corporate web. 'Handmade' is by no means the only or best term to define
                the web of this period.
                <br><br>
                In her essay, A Vernacular Web (2005), Olia Lialina describes the web of the mid-1990s as:
                bright, rich, personal, slow and under construction. It was a web of sudden connections and
                personal links. Pages were built on the edge of tomorrow, full of hope for a faster connection
                and a more powerful computer... it was a web of amateurs soon to be washed away by dot.com
                ambitions, professional authoring tools and guidelines designed by usability experts.
                For more information on Olia Lialina and Dragan Espenschied's excellent research on the
                amateur web, see: One Terabyte of Kilobyte Age: Digging through the Geocities Torrent.</p>

          <h2>Connection Between Handmade Web and Print</h2>
              <p>
              <strong>I evoke the term 'handmade web' in order to make a correlation between handmade web
              pages and handmade print materials, such as zines, pamphlets, and artists books.</strong>
                 <br><br>
              I made my first web-based work in 1995. The impetus for Fishes & Flying Things came from the
              material practices of fine art and book-making. The text evolved from an installation art
              exhibition I had on at the time. From this text, I created a small book-work which was meant to
              tell a circular story but when people got to the end they stopped reading because that's the way
              books work. In the web version, the last page linked to the first; the story circled round and
              round. Of the installation, no physical evidence remains. Of the book-work, only one copy. The
              QuarkExpress file is stored on a 44 MB SyQuest cartridge which I still own, but the contents of
              which I can no longer access. The handmade website, on the other hand, is still online and it still
              works.</p>
                <br><br>
        <h2>trAce Online Writing Centre: A Symbiotic Relationship</h2>
              <p>The handmade web emerged at a time when print and digital enjoyed a more symbiotic
              relationship. This is evident in the early output of the trAce Online Writing Centre founded at
              Nottingham Trent University in 1995. Over the next decade trAce evolved into one of the most
              influential online writing communities in the world. trAce's first output was a word-processed
              photocopied booklet which contained links to websites distributing journals and zines. Fittingly,
              trAce's last output was also a print booklet, in which it is stated:
                 <br>
              The trAce community embraced both camps, and some early chatlogs contain lively discussions
              about the use of mixed media in writing... The creative hypertexts and hypermedia in the trAce
              Archive can easily be compared to the multifarious pages of an artist's book. (PDF trAces: A
              Commemoration of Ten Years of Artistic Innovation at trAce, page 14)
                 <br><br>
              One of the many interesting things about the online archive of the trAce Online Writing Centre is
              how much it reflects the context of the creation and dissemination of its contents. Whereas
              archives held in museums or libraries generally contain artifacts created elsewhere —
              manuscripts illuminated in a monastery, for example, or photographs developed in a darkroom
              — the handmade web pages contained in this online archive continue to exist in the medium
              within which they were created. That said, the frames through which we view them continue to
              change.</p><br>
