        <h2>The Temporal Paradox of the Handmade Web</h2>
            <p>In "Media Archaeology: Method and Machine versus History and Narrative of Media" (2011)
            Wolfgang Ernst observes: "If a radio from a museum collection is reactivated to play broadcast
            channels of the present, it changes its status: it is not a historical object anymore but actively
            generates sensual and informational presence." Similarly, when viewing old web pages in modern browsers we are confronted with a temporal paradox. Layer upon layer of dated web-
            design aesthetics overlap and peel like wallpaper, revealing earlier versions beneath. Pages
            optimised for lower resolutions now take less than a third of the screen. Ghosts of browsers past
            mingle with occasional page errors, dead links, and missing images. Sound files play
            automatically. Warnings abound, issued from earlier eras, addressed to readers who are not us.
                <br><br>
            For example, M.D. Coverley's The Personalization of Complexity (2001) "explores the ways in
            which each of our personal computers have become idiosyncratic, individualized entities, only
            sometimes manageable by the owners." Fittingly, the piece itself warns that it is viewable only
            on Level 4 and 5 Microsoft Internet Explorer and Level 4 Netscape. Netscape 6 will not support
            many of the features in this essay.</p>
        <h2>The Living Web: Signposts from the Past</h2>
            <p>These are not artifacts of a dead web but rather, signposts on a map of a living web pointing to a
            web as it once was, a web in progress, a web in the making.
                 <br><br>
            <strong>I evoke the term 'handmade web' in order to advocate for an ongoing active engagement
            with the making of web pages and of web policies.</strong>
                 <br><br>
            In The Web We Lost (2012), Anil Dash writes: "In the early days of the social web, there was a
            broad expectation that regular people might own their own identities by having their own
            websites, instead of being dependent on a few big sites to host their online identity."
                 <br><br>
            In February 2015 the online journal <em>QUARTZ</em> published an article with the provocative
            headline: Millions of Facebook users have no idea they're using the internet. As the article
            states: "This is more than a matter of semantics. The expectations and behaviors of the next
            billion people to come online will have profound effects on how the internet evolves."</p>
        <h2>The Revival of Web 1.0</h2>
            <p>In October 2014 the online journal GIZMODO published an article heralding The Great Web 1.0
            Revival. Its author Kyle Chayka observed:
                <br>
            The booming size of today's mainstream social networks and the constant level of noise we
            have to deal with has inspired a sudden return to a time when the internet was quieter, safer,
            and more intimate... We're nostalgic for the close-knit, DIY nature of the early web, where
            everything was smaller...
                <br><br>
            The DIY aesthetics and practices of the mid-1990s have been embraced by the anti-social
            network TILDE.CLUB, which hosts a small community of users on a single unix computer. For
            some, TILDE.CLUB serves as a platform for revisiting amateur web aesthetics in a
            contemporary context. For example, on her page, Olia Lialina invites users to view a new net art
            work 640x480 - a 4-tab browser installation. For many others however, TILDE.CLUB has served
            as little more than a hip territory to occupy. Many pages remain blank.</p>
        
        <h2>Persistence of Web 1.0 Aesthetics</h2>
            <p>In other corners of the internet, Web 1.0 aesthetics have never disappeared. My own website,
            including this page, which uses fixed-width table cells, is based on a template I created in
            HomeSite in 1997.
                <br><br>
            Web 1.0 aesthetics persist in source code and stated objectives of the massive Ubu Web site,
            an "independent resource dedicated to all strains of the avant-garde, ethnopoetics, and outsider
            arts." On 16 December 2014, the founder of boasted on Twitter that "the whole damn site is still
            hand-coded in html 1.0 in bbedit, from templates made in 1996."
                <br><br>
            I shall put off updating my website templates until out-of-date design is no longer cool.</p>
