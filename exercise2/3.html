        <h2>The Labour of the Handmade Web</h2>
            <p>
            <strong>I evoke the term 'handmade web' in order to draw attention both to the manual labour
            involved in the composition of web pages, and the functioning of the web page itself as a
            'manual', a 'handbook', a set of instructions required for a computer program to run.</strong>
                <br><br>
            For most of its history web pages have been read on desktop or laptop computers. Readers
            have had the option of right-clicking on any page, selecting View Page Source, copying, pasting,
            and re-writing the source code. In this manner, readers become writers.
                <br><br>
            In February 2015, Matthew Rothberg created a website called Unindexed which continuously
            searched Google for itself. It survived for 22 days before being indexed, at which point it was
            permanently deleted. Rothberg has since shared the source code on GitHub, so you too can
            create a website which self-destructs the moment Google indexes it.
                <br><br>
            Dozens of readers have re-written the source code of Nick Montfortâ€™s Taroko Gorge (2008). For
            many, this was their first experience 'making' a computer-generated text.
                <br><br>
            I have rewritten Taroko Gorge three times. Further to the close relation between the handmade
            web and ephemeral print materials, excerpts of output and source code from the first
            iteration, Gorge (2010), were published in my very small press print
            book GENERATION[S] (2010), which, I believe, is now only available as a PDF. Gorge is a
            never-ending tract of computer-generated text spewing verse approximations, poetic paroxysms
            on food, consumption, decadence, and desire.</p>

        <h2>Physicality and Labour in the Handmade Web</h2>
            <p>
            <strong>I evoke the term 'handmade web' in order to draw attention to the physical body.</strong>
                <br><br>
            Consider the manual labour carried out by the mouse hand in Daniel Eatock's The One Mile
            Scroll (2008) A few entries appear at the top of the screen - Denver, The Mile High City - my
            grandfather's grave, Denver - after that we scroll and scroll. The hand is made to work. Through
            the labour of the body the virtual space of the browser window is transformed into an actual,
            physical distance.
                <br><br>
            Ironically, handheld devices have distanced us from the handmade web. In Reading Writing
            Interfaces: From the Digital to the Bookbound (2014), Lori Emerson argues: "The iPad works
            because users can't know how it works" (15). Reading the web on an iPhone, iPad, or similar
            device, readers do not have the option of viewing the page source. The iPad provides
            consumers with access to materials created by others, but cannot easily be used as a tool in the
            handcrafting of new materials.
