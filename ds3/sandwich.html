            On a quiet Saturday evening, Morgan turned on the <span class="hover-word" data-audio="./audios/gas stove.wav"> gas stove</span> and placed a pan on the burner. 
            She cracked an egg with a quick <span class="hover-word" id="hoverWord" data-audio="./audios/breaking_egg.wav">tap on the bowl</span> and poured it into the pan, the <span class="hover-word" id="hoverWord" data-audio="./audios/sizzling.mp3" preload="auto">sizzle</span> rising as it hit the heat. 
            After covering the pan with a <span class="hover-word" id="hoverWord" data-audio="./audios/pan close.wav">soft clink</span>, she grabbed some bread and started preparing for a sandwich. 
            While the egg cooked, she snacked on something <span class="hover-word" id="hoverWord" data-audio="./audios/crunchy.mp3" preload="auto">crunchy</span>, each bite crisp in the quiet room. 
            When the <span class="hover-word" id="hoverWord" data-audio="./audios/cooking_bell.wav" preload="auto">cooking bell</span> rang, she slid the egg onto the bread, added some toppings, and finished her sandwich. 
            Sitting down with her meal, she poured herself a cold beer, the <span class="hover-word" id="hoverWord" data-audio="./audios/Beer poured into glass.mp3" preload="auto">fizz</span> rising in the glass, and took a sip as she enjoyed her freshly made sandwich.
            <br><br>
            A moment later... she had sandwich too much, so she got indigestion. Now the ear accupuncture is needed.
