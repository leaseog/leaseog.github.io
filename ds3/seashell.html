            <h1>Anatomy of Ears</h1>

            <p style="color:rgb(118, 35, 57)">Lea walked along the beach and found a beautiful seashell shining in the sun. She picked it up and held it to her ear, wondering if the stories were true. To her surprise, she heard the sound of ocean waves crashing, as if the sea was whispering to her. Closing her eyes, she felt connected to the ocean, with its gentle rhythms coming from the simple shell.</p>

                The inner ear contains the cochlea, <strong>a spiral structure resembling a seashell</strong>, filled with fluid and lined with hair cells that convert sound vibrations into electrical signals for the brain to interpret. Interestingly, when you hold a seashell to your ear, the shape amplifies ambient sounds, creating a resonant effect that mimics ocean waves. While it's not actually the sound of the ocean, it's a blend of environmental noises that the seashell's design enhances, beautifully illustrating how the ear's intricate anatomy and natural forms like seashells influence our auditory experience.

                The ear is divided into three main parts: 
                <br>
                <ul style="text-align: center;">
                    <li>the outer ear</li>
                    <li>the middle ear</li>
                    <li>the inner ear</li>
                </ul>

                The outer ear captures sound waves, which travel through the ear canal to the eardrum. 
                The middle ear amplifies these sound vibrations, while the inner ear, particularly the cochlea, converts them into electrical signals that the brain interprets as sound. 
                The inner ear also contains the vestibular system, which is crucial for balance.
