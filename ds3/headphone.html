            <h1>Maintaining Healthy Ears</h1>
            <h3>How much do you know about your ear health?</h3>
            <p>
                Lea was in her living room, enjoying her favorite playlist through her new Bluetooth headphone. The music was loud and energizing, filling the entire space. She turned up the volume even more, wanting to feel the beat as she went about her day. After a few songs, she noticed a strange sensation in her right ear - a slight ringing, and it felt uncomfortable. She paused the music, unsure of what was happening, and sat down, rubbing her ear.
                <br><br>
                As she sat there, she wondered, Did I play the music too loud? Morgan began to feel concerned about her hearing, realizing she had never really thought much about ear health before.</p>
